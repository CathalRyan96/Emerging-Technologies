# Emerging Technologies Project

<h2>Main Objective</h2>
The main objective of this project was to create four Jupyter Notebooks and one python script.
The content that is required is as follows:

1. A Jupyter notebook explaining the concepts behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots and various distrubutions.

2. A Jupyter Notebook explaining the famous Iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of the iris based on the variables in the set.

3. A Jupter Notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

4. A Python Script that takes an image file containing handwritten digits and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

5. A Jupyter Notebook explaining how the above Python Script works and disscussing its performance.

<h2>Technology Used</h2>

1. Visual Studio Code

2. Github

3. Python Programming Language

<h2>How to run this repository</h2>

1. First you need to make sure you have anaconda installed in order to run the script. Once it installed correctly, simply navigate to the script file in the command prompt and type "python digit-rec.py"

2. In order to run the jupyter note books, simply navigate to the "Emerging-Technologies" folder in the command prompt and type "jupter notebook". This will then open the notebooks in your preffered browser.
